# Summary

For my college web project I've decided to make a webforum in python.

# The Final Goal
It'll look professional and have the expected functionality

# Current Goals
- Let the user login/register an account
- Users can post, view any posts, leave a comment on a post, and view comments on a post.
- Users can view their profile

# Planned but might not be implemented

- Have an (fake)advertisement that send the user to another page when clicked.

- Have an ad to go back to the forum.

- Have an ad that has some basic functionality
