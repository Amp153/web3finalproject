# web3finalproject

# Summary

For my college web project I've decided to make a webforum in python.

# The Final Goal
It'll look professional and have the expected functionality

# Current Goals
- Let the user login/register an account
- Users can post, view any posts, leave a comment on a post, and view comments on a post
- Users can view their profile

# Planned but might not be implemented
- Lots more functionality

# Resources used
- I'm using the guide found at this tutorial to get the project started so some code is bound to be similar if not identical
